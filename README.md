LoL Inspector is a learning tool for any League of Legends player. Players are able to search by summoner name to view recent matches of players (North America classic-mode only). While other sites will display match stats of all players within a given match, LoL inspector takes the data from a player's match and compares the player's individual stats against an opposing lane player. This will allow people to see where a player can improve whether it be garnering kills or placing more wards during a game. Ultimately, the goal of LoL inspector is to help make the community improve their gameplay.

## Future Goals

1. Add a search function on the nav bar.

2. Add more in-depth analyses depending on a player's role and lane. Examples would be a strong focus on vision control for supports and damage dealt for ADC's.
